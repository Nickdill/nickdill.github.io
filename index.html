        During my junior year of high school, I rented a server for $5 and downloaded Mojang's public Minecraft Server. I posted ads on a few popular Minecraft forums, and low and behold Dynacraft began. Dynacraft was the first Minecraft server I created, simply because I enjoyed the game and thought I could create a server better than the rest. With absolutely zero intention of turning a profit, I rented more servers as the demand grew. Rather simply, people started donating money for a bunch of extra content.
        As this revenue continued to grow, I expanded my project. I upgraded my servers, then started renting even more, and created new websites and communites for each one.
        <br><br>Tyrantcraft, inspired from Tyrantsoft, became by far my most successful community. I managed to create my own java plugins, and create some amazing graphic artwork for ads which helped populate this particular server with over 100 players at peak times. (For a minecraft server, this was pretty dang good)
        During Tyrantcraft's most successful month, I was able to make over $2,000 in revenue. I was also able to automate almost every aspect of work that had to be done. I connected the website to the server so that PayPal transactions would automatically and instantly award players for their donations to the server.
        Basically, this meant I could spend less time performing autonomous tasks and more time doing productive stuff.
        <br><br>The community I created was so strong that dedicated players begged to become a part of my team and take on the responsibilites of watching over the server while I was away.
        I managed to interview my own team and create a group of moderators who I would work with to constantly improve the community. However, eventually my studies overwhelmed me and overtime I slowly closed these servers as I ended my first semester of college.
        Since then, I have sold Tyrantsoft and all of its content but this experience inspired me to start a new company, Stormfell. With Stormfell I plan to create more plugins, mobile apps, and generally amazing programs throughout my future.

        This is the first project of my Data Structures class at Berkeley. It consisted of a GUI provided by the professors and a few basic testing and compiling tools. This project implements basic data storage fundamentals in a rather fun way. It is a perfect replica of Gabriele Cirulli's 2048, but written in Java. Also, this version of 2048 is scalable and can be played on a board of any n by n size (so long as n is > 3).

          I have worked on many projects throughout my career, ranging from small java plugins to bigger and more complex game algorithms. Above I have demonstrated four of my favorites. Tyrantsoft was a small startup I began my junior year of high school. 2048 was a school project in which I rebuilt 2048 with an API provided by Berkeley,
           and altered it so that it could be played on a board of any n by n size. DBMS is short for a relational database management system I built as another school project. Ninth Iron was a band I began in middle school, however I believe my role as a leader and the band's success makes it one of my favorite accomplishments. Feel free to click on any of the above projects for more information.

        During my junior year of high school, I rented a server for $5 and downloaded Mojang's public Minecraft Server. I posted ads on a few popular Minecraft forums, and low and behold Dynacraft began. Dynacraft was the first Minecraft server I created, simply because I enjoyed the game and thought I could create a server better than the rest. With absolutely zero intention of turning a profit, I rented more servers as the demand grew. Rather simply, people started donating money for a bunch of extra content.
        As this revenue continued to grow, I expanded my project. I upgraded my servers, then started renting even more, and created new websites and communites for each one.
        <br><br>Tyrantcraft, inspired from Tyrantsoft, became by far my most successful community. I managed to create my own java plugins, and create some amazing graphic artwork for ads which helped populate this particular server with over 100 players at peak times. (For a minecraft server, this was pretty dang good)
        During Tyrantcraft's most successful month, I was able to make over $2,000 in revenue. I was also able to automate almost every aspect of work that had to be done. I connected the website to the server so that PayPal transactions would automatically and instantly award players for their donations to the server.
        Basically, this meant I could spend less time performing autonomous tasks and more time doing productive stuff.
        <br><br>The community I created was so strong that dedicated players begged to become a part of my team and take on the responsibilites of watching over the server while I was away.
        I managed to interview my own team and create a group of moderators who I would work with to constantly improve the community. However, eventually my studies overwhelmed me and overtime I slowly closed these servers as I ended my first semester of college.
        Even today though, Tyrantsoft continues as I plan to create more plugins, mobile apps, and generally amazing programs throughout my future.

        This is the first project of my Data Structures class at Berkeley. It consisted of a GUI provided by the professors and a few basic testing and compiling tools. This project implements basic data storage fundamentals in a rather fun way. It is a perfect replica of Gabriele Cirulli's 2048, but written in Java. Also, this version of 2048 is scalable and can be played on a board of any n by n size (so long as n is > 3).

      I am a self taught musician. I started with piano, by reading books on my own. Then I moved onto guitar, learning "Sweet Child of Mine" as my first song. (Including the first solo too...)
      In my free time I also give guitar lessons to students all over my neighborhood.
      <br><br>
      Though Ninth Iron has little to do with computer programming, I included it here since I believe it helps prove that I am very well-rounded.
      Ninth Iron was a band, that I first started in middle school with a few good friends.
      It was my first real role as a leader. I played lead guitar in this band, and took the responsibilities of organizing all of our practices at my house, creating a website, twitter, facebook page, and
      finding our first gigs.
      Throughout high school, we continued playing at birthdays and other events. We might not have been the best, but we had a lot of fun, and people enjoyed our music which is more than enough to motivate us to keep doing it. Our largest crowd was roughly 450 people.
